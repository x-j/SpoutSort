# [Unreleased]

## [1.1.1] - 2019-04-08

looking for mac owners to check if this thing works on your os!!! (⌒_⌒;)

- pixelSorting images no longer fries your CPU (removed the need to render more than 1 frame for images)
- removed framerate cap (shouldn't affect the overall performance that much. meaning it will be still crap)
- fixed wrong spoutcontrol parameters
- opened files now rescale to fit the findow preserving aspect ratio

# [Released]

## [1.1.0] - 2019-04-07

Some responded that they were having troubles with using this as an FFGL plugin in Resolume. You may be happy to hear that I found a possible culprit, but you won't be happy to hear that: it's most probably SpoutControls at fault here. I suggest that after you download the new version, use the procedure described in [the greatest tutorial I've ever read by Eric Medine](http://ericmedine.com/spout-controller-for-resolume/) and re-deploy my script on your machine. yay, bug fixes!

- new feature lets you speed up and slow down videos ･'(*⌒―⌒*))) try it!
